# Heart Shape with Assembly Language in 8086 Compiler

## Description
This project demonstrates how to create a heart shape using assembly language for the 8086 microprocessor. The program leverages low-level programming concepts to produce a graphical representation of a heart shape, showcasing creativity and technical skills in assembly language programming.

## Features
- Written in pure assembly language for the 8086 microprocessor.
- Outputs a heart shape using character graphics.
- Demonstrates understanding of interrupts, loops, and data manipulation in assembly.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need:
- An 8086 emulator or compiler, such as:
  - [EMU8086](https://yjdoc2.github.io/8086-emulator-web/compile)
  - [OneCompiler](https://onecompiler.com/assembly)
- A basic understanding of assembly language and the 8086 architecture.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wyattmatt/Heart-In-8086-Assembly.git
   ```
2. Open the `.asm` file in your preferred 8086 compiler or emulator.
3. Assemble and run the program.

## Usage
1. Open your 8086 compiler/emulator.
2. Load the `.asm` file.
3. Assemble the program using the `assemble` or `compile` option.
4. Run the program to view the heart shape output on the screen.

## Code Explanation
The program uses:
- **Interrupts** for screen manipulation.
- **Loops** to create the symmetrical shape of a heart.
- **Registers** to control the flow and position of characters on the screen.

## Example Output
```
